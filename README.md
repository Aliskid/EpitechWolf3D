# EpitechWolf3D
A very pink school project. 2014/2015. Raycasting. 

There might be some errors, it doesn't compiles on every device. 

Segfault but hey ! One of my first projects at Epitech (with my friends, first year). 
Not completed at 100% but kind of funny to see. Don't try, you can't go throught the walls. I did my job well haha

Basic commands : my_putchar, my_strlen, my_pustr... I didn't take the time to replace them by the real functions (printf...). 

On MacOS : you can have some struggle. Install what you need to make it work.
